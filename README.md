# Namekart-Domain-Name-Evaluation

# Phase 1
1. Namekart_Price_Data_analysis.ipynb- Data analysis and data preparation of the dataset i created and used to train the model
2. Namekart_Price_Model_test.ipynb - used various ways to create and train the model and get prediction
3. Model_Namekart_Unsuccessful.ipynb - Created first good model using transformer distilBERT and plot graphs of loss and other metrics. Model failed as it was not good, giving very low accuracy probably due to the bad dataset i prepared.
4. data.csv - this is the data i used to train the model

# Phase 2
